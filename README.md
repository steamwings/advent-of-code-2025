🎄 Advent of Code 2025 🎄

https://adventofcode.com/

My goal is to learn a little Rust; my ~shame~ mediocre effort is on full display. But hey, even a non-mathematically-proficient mouse occasionally finds a log(O) cheese.

```sh
# run some things
./run.sh 01 # run day 1 part 1 from puzzle input
./run.sh 01 --sample # run day 1 part 1 from sample input
./run.sh 01 --test # run day 1 part 1 with test input
./run.sh 01 --part=2 --sample # run day 1 part 2 code from sample input
```
